# Cargo integration

## Required structural relationship

Vapor source roots are Cargo-aware, but `[root]` and `[workspace]` have
different shapes.

```text
normal workspace/
├── Workspace.vapor.toml    # [workspace]
└── Cargo.toml    # Cargo workspace

app root/
├── App-Source.vapor.toml    # [root]
├── .gitmodules
└── Vapor-CLI/
    ├── Workspace.vapor.toml    # [workspace]
    └── Cargo.toml
```

`[workspace]` roots must contain a root `Cargo.toml`. `[root]` is not itself a
Cargo workspace; its direct submodules that declare `[workspace]` and contain
`Cargo.toml` are routed as Cargo workspaces.

Inside a Cargo workspace, role-specific content manifests describe Vapor
content packages. Ordinary non-content crates are described by Cargo only. They
are not standalone source roots.

## Separate authorities

The word *manifest* must always be qualified in documentation and diagnostics:

- Vapor manifests own Vapor identity, content composition, Steam app policy,
  and workflow intent. Application source roots use
  `App-Source.vapor.toml`; installed app roots use `App.vapor.toml`; ordinary
  workspaces use `Workspace.vapor.toml`; content artifacts use role-specific
  filenames such as `Engine.vapor.toml` or `Packagepack.vapor.toml`.
- `Cargo.toml` is the Cargo manifest. It owns Rust packages, crates, features,
  dependencies, targets, profiles, and Cargo workspace policy.

Cargo does not infer Vapor identity. Vapor does not duplicate Cargo's Rust build
graph. Vapor workflows use Cargo facts where Cargo is authoritative.

## Derived metadata

`cargo metadata` is the canonical machine-readable projection of a Cargo
manifest. It reports workspace members, package manifests, targets, the Cargo
workspace root, and target directory. The command output is rebuildable; the
`Cargo.toml` that produces it is not.

Vapor invokes its bundled Cargo for a discovered Cargo workspace:

```text
cargo metadata --format-version 1 --no-deps --manifest-path <workspace>/Cargo.toml
```

`--format-version 1` pins Cargo's JSON contract. `--no-deps` keeps the
projection focused on workspace packages without resolving the full dependency
graph.

## Validation and recovery

For Cargo-backed workflows:

- a `[workspace]` source root without `Cargo.toml` is invalid Vapor structure;
- a `[root]` child workspace with malformed Vapor or Cargo policy is invalid
  source structure;
- malformed Cargo policy or incompatible metadata blocks Cargo-backed
  workflows;
- a missing app-local Cargo executable is an unmet setup prerequisite, not
  permission to fall back to host Cargo.

`vapor metadata` reports these states without hiding otherwise recoverable
context. Commands that require Rust tooling fail their targeted preflight before
performing work.

The official Cargo documentation defines the metadata JSON contract:
<https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-metadata.html>.
