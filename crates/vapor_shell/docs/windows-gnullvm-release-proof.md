# Windows GNU/LLVM release proof

This checklist proves the Windows side of the release target matrix without
publishing Steam depot or Workshop changes. Steam's default launch opens Vapor
Studio through the native entrypoint. Shell and Installer remain separate
terminal recovery options; the Shell launch script runs the script-owned
player-mode install through the `vapor-installer` shim before Shell starts.

The target is:

```text
x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm
```

## Steam launch

The Windows Vapor Studio launch option should be the Steam default and target
the native entrypoint shipped in the target-specific depot:

```text
executable: bin\x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm\vapor-entrypoint.exe
arguments:  studio
```

The separate Play option uses the same executable with `play`; it opens Studio
in direct-play mode. Shell and Installer are recovery options:

```text
executable: bin\x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm\vapor-entrypoint.exe
arguments:  shell
```

Clicking Shell should open a persistent `cmd` window running Vapor Shell. The
user should not need to install Git before clicking Shell.

The installer should also be exposed as its own launch option:

```text
executable: bin\x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm\vapor-entrypoint.exe
arguments:  installer
```

Clicking Installer should open a persistent `cmd` window running
`vapor-installer` directly. It should not run the quiet player-mode install
before showing the installer/status surface.

## First-run installer

Player-mode install is automatic through the launch path. For development
build/proof work from a source checkout, run the script directly:

```text
rust-script tools\production\app_setup\setup_development.rs --app-root "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Loo Cast"
```

Expected setup behavior:

- Rustup is downloaded and run with `RUSTUP_HOME` and `CARGO_HOME` inside the
  Steam app root.
- SteamCMD is downloaded as the Windows zip and extracted under
  `tools\steamcmd`.
- Zig is downloaded as the portable Windows zip and extracted under
  `tools\zig`; Vapor writes linker wrappers under `tools\cross`.
- llvm-mingw is downloaded as a portable archive and extracted under
  `tools\llvm-mingw`.

No downloaded setup component should run a system installer, write to a global
Git/tool location, or mutate machine-wide PATH state.

The Windows GNU/LLVM and Linux GNU cross-linker path is app-local and portable.
Vapor uses llvm-mingw from `tools\llvm-mingw` for Windows GNU/LLVM and Zig
from `tools\zig` for Linux GNU cross-links. This proof must not require Visual
Studio, MSVC, system MinGW, or a machine-wide compiler install.

## Source handoff

The source import/template command is still a product gap. Until that exists,
the source root must be present by one of these explicit handoff methods:

- a prepared source checkout or archive;
- a future Vapor workspace/template import command;
- a manual clone using a developer-installed Git provider.

If Git-backed source work is needed for this proof, install Git as a developer
tool on the host and link it inside Vapor Shell:

```cmd
provider git link "C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe"
```

Normal Steam play does not require Git.

## Windows build

Set paths for the local machine:

```cmd
set "APP_ROOT=C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Loo Cast"
set "REPOS=%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Loo Cast Repos"
set "VAPOR=%APP_ROOT%\bin\x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm\vapor.exe"
```

Build and promote the Windows Vapor Shell app binary:

```cmd
"%VAPOR%" source open "%REPOS%\Vapor-Root"
"%VAPOR%" root build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm
```

Build the first-party Loo-Cast content runtime outputs:

```cmd
"%VAPOR%" source open "%REPOS%\Loo-Cast"
"%VAPOR%" content build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm
```

Build the example runtime outputs:

```cmd
"%VAPOR%" source open "%REPOS%\Vapor-Root\Vapor-Examples"
"%VAPOR%" content build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm
```

This proof expects the app-root
`resources/vapor/tools/production/app_setup/setup_development.rs` tool to have
prepared app-local Rustup state, Cargo state, SteamCMD, Zig, and linker wrappers.
Git remains a linked provider rather than a player-mode setup dependency. No
Microsoft compiler/linker toolchain is part of this proof path.

## Windows artifact checks

Confirm these files exist:

```text
%APP_ROOT%\bin\x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm\vapor.exe
%APP_ROOT%\output\dev\loo-cast\x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm\debug\spacetime-engine.exe
%APP_ROOT%\output\dev\loo-cast\x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm\debug\loo_cast_game.dll
%APP_ROOT%\output\dev\vapor-examples\x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm\debug\terminal-engine.exe
%APP_ROOT%\output\dev\vapor-examples\x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm\debug\hello_world_on_steroids_game.dll
```

The exact `.dll` names come from Cargo crate names. If a content artifact adds
or removes declared `libraries` later, update this checklist with the new
declared runtime outputs from that artifact's role manifest.

## Handoff back to Linux

Copy these Windows app-root paths back to the Linux publishing app root,
preserving the same relative paths:

```text
bin\x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm\
output\dev\loo-cast\x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm\debug\
output\dev\vapor-examples\x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm\debug\
```

The root app package only needs `bin\x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm\vapor.exe`.
Content dry-runs and Workshop package dry-runs need the `output\dev\...`
directories because `content package` stages runtime outputs from app-local
Cargo output.

## Linux staging proof

After copying the Windows artifacts into the Linux Steam app root, prove the
release matrix without rebuilding Windows on Linux:

```text
source open /home/leslieghf/Documents/GitHub/Loo Cast Repos/Vapor-Root
root publish --skip-build --dry-run
```

Expected app staging shape:

```text
output/root/content/linux/bin/vapor-launch.sh
output/root/content/linux/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/vapor
output/root/content/linux/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/vapor-entrypoint
output/root/content/linux/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/vapor-installer
output/root/content/linux/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/vapor-gui
output/root/content/linux/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/vapor-ide-host
output/root/content/windows/bin/vapor-launch.cmd
output/root/content/windows/bin/x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm/vapor.exe
output/root/content/windows/bin/x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm/vapor-entrypoint.exe
output/root/content/windows/bin/x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm/vapor-installer.exe
output/root/content/windows/bin/x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm/vapor-gui.exe
output/root/content/windows/bin/x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm/vapor-ide-host.exe
output/root/content/windows/bin/x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm/libunwind.dll
```

Then prove the Loo-Cast Workshop package preview:

```text
source open /home/leslieghf/Documents/GitHub/Loo Cast Repos/Loo-Cast
content publish ghf-studios/loo-cast/spacetime-engine ghf-studios/loo-cast/loo-cast-game ghf-studios/loo-cast/loo-cast-packagepack --dry-run
```

No command in this checklist performs a real Steam upload. Real publication
still requires manually typed `--account ACCOUNT --yes` after reviewing the
staged payloads and provider scripts.
