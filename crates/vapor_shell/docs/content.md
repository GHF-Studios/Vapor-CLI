# Content lifecycle

Vapor content commands manage Workshop-backed runtime content from the Steam
installation/app root. Source stays outside the app root; installed content is
runtime material, not a Git checkout.

## App-root layout

Generated content state uses this app-owned layout:

```text
content/
├── workshop/downloads/          provider-observed Steam downloads
├── cache/packages/              Vapor-managed package cache
├── installed/                   enabled artifact roots by content ID
├── disabled/                    retained disabled artifact roots by content ID
└── quarantine/                  corrupt or incomplete artifact roots

output/content/
├── packages/                    staged deployable artifact roots
└── scripts/                     Workshop provider VDF previews

.vapor/state/content/
├── index.toml                   installed/cache index
├── locks/                       per-artifact resolved install records
├── selection.toml                selected packagepack
└── receipts/                    package, acquire, install, publish, repair receipts
```

Role-specific content manifests are the content metadata carriers. In a source
workspace they hold authoring intent: content role, version policy,
dependencies, conflicts, composition, AppID, PublishedFileId when one exists,
visibility, title, tags, update intent, and declared runtime outputs such as
`binaries` and `libraries`.
Source content is only content when its child path is registered by the
workspace manifest:

```toml
[[workspace.projects]]
path = "spacetime-engine"
```

The child role manifest, for example `Engine.vapor.toml` or
`Packagepack.vapor.toml`, owns the content role and metadata; the workspace
registration owns membership in the workspace. Vapor does not recursively guess
content membership from every nested manifest it finds.
Studio can unregister an existing project by removing its registry entry. This
leaves the project files and Cargo membership untouched; the folder then appears
in the unregistered-project scan and can be adopted again.

When `content package` stages an artifact, Vapor writes a resolved deployed
role-specific manifest into the artifact root and copies declared runtime
outputs into target-specific `bin/<target>/` and `lib/<target>/` directories so
the installed or Workshop-downloaded artifact remains self-describing without
becoming a standalone source workspace. The deployed manifest records the
actual staged files under `[[engine.runtime]]`, `[[game.runtime]]`, or the
matching content section. Fingerprints, installed paths, cache observations,
locks, receipts, and repair diagnostics are generated state and stay under the
app root.

`content build`, `content deploy`, and `content package` accept
`--target TARGET` for explicit platform output such as
`x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm`. When `[workspace.runtime].targets` is declared in
`Workspace.vapor.toml`, omitting target flags uses that full matrix by
default. `--release-targets` is accepted as an explicit spelling of the same
manifest-matrix behavior.
`content package`, `content create`, and `content publish` may repeat
`--target` to stage a custom subset into one package root. Use `--host-only`
for quick local smoke passes that should read the normal app-local Cargo output
directory. Manifest or explicit targets read from
`output/dev/<workspace>/<target>/debug/` and stage files under the same target
name inside the deployed content root.
For real Workshop create/publish, the custom target flags are disabled: Vapor
requires the declared workspace runtime matrix to include both Linux and
Windows, then validates and builds that matrix before packaging and upload.
Custom subsets and host-only staging are preview/local paths only.

This is the release shape for Workshop content. A Workshop item represents one
logical content artifact and may carry every shipped runtime target under the
same artifact root. Vapor does not split Linux and Windows content into
separate Workshop items or separate app roots; platform-specific material is
selected from `bin/<target>/` and `lib/<target>/` after download/install.

## New content workspace

The installed app can create a minimal engine/game/packagepack workspace:

```text
source init basic-content /path/to/my-content --organization my-studio --name my-content
content validate
content deploy my-studio/my-content/my-content-packagepack --select
```

The template is intentionally small. It creates a normal Cargo workspace and
normal Vapor content projects; it does not create proprietary sidecar metadata.

For first Workshop publication, create dependency items first and repair
dependency Workshop IDs between steps:

```text
content create my-studio/my-content/my-content-engine --account ACCOUNT --yes
source repair --write
content create my-studio/my-content/my-content-game --account ACCOUNT --yes
source repair --write
content create my-studio/my-content/my-content-packagepack --account ACCOUNT --yes
```

After all items have PublishedFileIds, updates use normal batch publication:

```text
source repair --write
content publish my-studio/my-content/my-content-engine my-studio/my-content/my-content-game my-studio/my-content/my-content-packagepack --account ACCOUNT --yes
```

## Loo-Cast first-party workspace

Open Loo-Cast as a normal workspace:

```text
source open /path/to/Loo-Cast
content list
content validate
```

The first-party product artifacts are:

```text
ghf-studios/loo-cast/spacetime-engine
ghf-studios/loo-cast/loo-cast-game
ghf-studios/loo-cast/loo-cast-packagepack
```

They are registered in `Loo-Cast/Workspace.vapor.toml` under
`[[workspace.projects]]`.
Prototype/demo content belongs in `Vapor-Examples`, not in this product
workspace.

Run the safe local roundtrip with:

```text
script run content-roundtrip
```

That script packages, subscribes/acquires, downloads/caches, installs the
packagepack dependency closure, verifies fingerprints, updates, disables,
enables, repairs, and uninstalls without touching Steam authority.
It also selects and clears the packagepack through app-owned selection state.

## Workshop publication boundary

Preview publication with:

```text
script run content-publish-preview
```

or manually:

```text
content publish ghf-studios/loo-cast/spacetime-engine ghf-studios/loo-cast/loo-cast-game ghf-studios/loo-cast/loo-cast-packagepack --dry-run
```

The dry-run writes packages and Workshop provider VDFs but performs no upload.
Real Workshop updates require an existing `published-file-id`, an account, and
manual interactive confirmation:

```text
content publish ghf-studios/loo-cast/spacetime-engine ghf-studios/loo-cast/loo-cast-game ghf-studios/loo-cast/loo-cast-packagepack --account ACCOUNT --yes
```

For platform-specific runtime payloads, the default release path builds and
publishes the workspace target matrix:

```text
content build
content publish ghf-studios/loo-cast/spacetime-engine ghf-studios/loo-cast/loo-cast-game ghf-studios/loo-cast/loo-cast-packagepack --dry-run
```

For quick local Linux iteration, opt out explicitly:

```text
content deploy ghf-studios/loo-cast/loo-cast-packagepack --select --host-only
```

Scripts cannot perform real Workshop create, publish, or delete operations.
Those authority-changing steps must be typed manually in the interactive shell.

Studio-reviewed uploads use a stricter operation: Studio supplies the reviewed
package fingerprint, Vapor stages the payload again, verifies the fingerprint,
copies the verified package to operation-owned temporary storage, and uploads
that exact copy. Source changes between review and upload stop the operation;
the receipt records the payload fingerprint.

## Corruption and repair

`content verify` recomputes fingerprints from installed artifact roots and
compares them with app-owned locks and receipts. `content repair` quarantines
corrupted artifact roots under `content/quarantine/` and reinstalls from source
or cache when available. If neither source nor cache can satisfy the item,
Vapor reports the missing provider instead of silently deleting or replacing
content.
