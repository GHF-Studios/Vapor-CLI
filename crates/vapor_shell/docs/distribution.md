# Distribution and app/depot staging

Vapor-Root is the app/depot source root. Its `App-Source.vapor.toml` declares
`[root]`, `[root.steam]`, and the split-depot file membership. The shipped app
root carries `App.vapor.toml` as its runtime app marker. Vapor-Root does not
package Workshop content into the app root and does not duplicate Cargo or Git
submodule membership.

```toml
[root.steam]
app-id = 2122620
development-branch = "vapor-dev"

```

The depot IDs are the Steamworks DepotIDs. The include list is the source of
truth for file membership. `root = "source"` copies from the Vapor-Root source
checkout; `root = "installation"` copies from the Steam app root. `target`
limits an include to package/publish commands that stage that runtime target.

`root publish --dry-run` reconstructs clean Steam depot payloads under
`output/root/content` inside the app root and writes a preview SteamPipe app
build VDF plus one depot build VDF per staged depot without uploading. The
payload is split by the manifest-declared Steam depot includes:

- `common/` contains OS-neutral files: `App.vapor.toml`, `docs/`,
  `resources/vapor/vapor-scripts/` when runtime startup scripts are present, and
  `examples/vapor-examples/` when the root source includes official examples.
- `linux/` contains Linux runtime files: selected Linux `bin/<target>/`
  application binaries including `vapor`, `vapor-entrypoint`,
  `vapor-installer`, `vapor-studio`, and `vapor-ide-host`, plus
  `bin/vapor-launch.sh`.
- `windows/` contains Windows runtime files: selected Windows `bin/<target>/`
  application binaries including `vapor.exe`, `vapor-entrypoint.exe`,
  `vapor-installer.exe`, `vapor-studio.exe`, and `vapor-ide-host.exe`, required
  Windows runtime DLLs, plus `bin/vapor-launch.cmd`.

Source repositories, Cargo build targets, Cargo registries, Git checkouts,
Steam authentication, installer logs, generated app-root state, and SteamPipe
cache state are not staged.
The examples payload is source material for learning and templating; it is
copied without its `.git/` or `target/` directories and is not Workshop content.
SteamPipe VDF file bodies live as checked-in source templates under
`resources/steam/steampipe-templates/`; Vapor Shell loads them from the active
source checkout and fills IDs, paths, branch, and description values at publish
time. The templates are distribution policy, not Shell crate assets and not
runtime depot content unless `App-Source.vapor.toml` explicitly includes them.

Source-controlled support assets live under visible `resources/` paths. The
installed app-root `.vapor/` directory is reserved for disposable generated
state such as logs, diagnostics runs, content cache, and receipts.

When `[root.runtime].targets` is declared, no target flag means release-matrix
staging. Repeat `--target` to build and stage a deliberate custom subset. Use
`--host-only` for quick local packages that should not require or advertise
other platform launch scripts. Staging always includes the common depot plus
the platform depots implied by the selected targets, and fails when a selected
`bin/<target>/` directory is missing after the build refresh.

Real `root publish` does not accept custom target subsets, `--host-only`, or
`--skip-build`. It validates, builds, promotes, stages, and uploads the complete
declared Linux+Windows runtime matrix. Those escape hatches exist only for
`root package` target selection and `root publish --dry-run` staging previews.

Release staging is one app build with split depot roots. Steamworks should
mount the common depot for every OS, the Linux depot only for Linux, and the
Windows depot only for Windows. This prevents Linux Steam clients from selecting
the Windows/Proton launch path because of a mixed mono-depot payload.

For a release assembled from artifacts built on multiple machines, import the
target-specific app binaries into `bin/<target>/`, then use
`root publish --skip-build --dry-run` only as a preview that confirms the
imported files stage correctly.

Steam's default launch target is Studio and starts the sibling GUI directly.
Play also opens Studio, with `--play` to run the selected composition. Shell
and Installer are separate terminal recovery options:

```text
bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/vapor-entrypoint studio
  -> bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/vapor-studio

bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/vapor-entrypoint play
  -> bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/vapor-studio --play

bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/vapor-entrypoint shell
  -> Konsole -> bin/vapor-launch.sh --hold shell
  -> bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/vapor

bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/vapor-entrypoint installer
  -> Konsole -> bin/vapor-launch.sh --hold installer
  -> bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/vapor-installer

bin\x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm\vapor-entrypoint.exe studio
  -> bin\x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm\vapor-studio.exe

bin\x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm\vapor-entrypoint.exe play
  -> bin\x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm\vapor-studio.exe --play

bin\x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm\vapor-entrypoint.exe shell
  -> cmd /C -> bin\vapor-launch.cmd --hold shell
  -> bin\x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm\vapor.exe
  -> cmd /K after Vapor exits

bin\x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm\vapor-entrypoint.exe installer
  -> cmd /C -> bin\vapor-launch.cmd --hold installer
  -> bin\x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm\vapor-installer.exe
  -> cmd /K after Vapor Installer exits
```

The launch scripts run the shipped `vapor-installer install` shim first for
Shell launch targets. The shim delegates to the script-owned setup layer,
then the launch script selects the installed platform binary and command. The
Installer launch target opens `vapor-installer` directly and skips headless
install. Bootstrap failure is recorded as
`<app-root>/.vapor/state/installer/bootstrap-failure.txt`; the launch wrapper
prints only the session banner, failures, and terminal-hold message. The real
implementation remains Vapor Shell. Entry points and scripts are not a
substitute for target-specific app or content payloads; Vapor itself, engines,
games, tools, and dynamic libraries all need runtime outputs staged per
supported target.

The publish preflight requires app-local Rust/Cargo and cross-build tooling for
the release matrix, a linked developer Git provider for explicit Git-backed
workflows, plus SteamCMD for real upload. Player-mode and developer-mode setup
are owned by app-root tools under `<app-root>/resources/vapor/tools/`.

The root source owns the tool payload under `resources/vapor/tools`; root
build/package/publish copies that payload into the installed app root. The
generated mutable state those tools create remains outside SteamPipe staging.
`vapor-installer` still uses the same shared implementation in-process so
first-run setup does not depend on `rust-script` already being available.

Workshop content is separate from this depot flow. A workspace such as
Loo-Cast can publish Workshop items and packagepacks, but the content itself is
not part of Vapor-Root's app payload.
