# Architecture

## Purpose

Vapor Shell gives authored source a stable command environment without making
that source part of the Steam installation/app root. The executable may be
globally reachable through PATH; process invocation does not determine source
ownership or widen filesystem access.

## Authority hierarchy

1. Vapor manifests are authoritative for Vapor identity, composition, Steam app
   policy, and workflow intent. Application source roots use
   `App-Source.vapor.toml`; installed app roots use `App.vapor.toml`; ordinary
   workspaces use `Workspace.vapor.toml`; content artifacts use role-specific
   filenames.
2. `Cargo.toml` is authoritative for Rust workspaces, packages, targets,
   dependencies, features, and profiles.
3. Canonical filesystem paths are authoritative for containment.
4. `cargo metadata` output is a rebuildable projection of Cargo authority.
5. Prompt context and command output are derived views.

Cargo metadata never creates, renames, or redefines a Vapor entity. Declaration
IDs are inferred from `name` and source-root context; references use fully
qualified IDs.

## Source roots

Vapor accepts two source-root kinds:

- `[root]`: the pure Vapor application source/depot super-repository. It is not a
  Cargo workspace. Direct submodules that declare `[workspace]` and contain
  `Cargo.toml` become routed Cargo workspaces.
- `[workspace]`: a normal Vapor/Cargo source workspace rooted in the same
  directory as its `Cargo.toml`.

Content manifests cannot be standalone source roots. Starting inside
Vapor-CLI, a game, an engine, or another nested artifact escalates to the
highest containing `[root]` or `[workspace]`.

The Steam installation is the app root, not a source root. It is discovered from
the running executable.

## Session startup

```text
current_exe() ── ancestors ──> installed app [root]
                                  │
current_dir()/remembered path ──> external source [root] or [workspace]
                                  │
                    reject if either root overlaps
                                  │
                  compare app-root registration
                                  │
                 validate source Vapor identity
                                  │
                  discover routed Cargo workspaces
                                  │
                    project Cargo metadata with
                  bundled Cargo when it is installed
                                  │
                         enter interactive loop
```

## State ownership

`ShellState` owns one immutable pair of discovered roots and mutable source-only
navigation state. The current directory can never become an installation path.
Installation commands print or execute explicit resources without changing the
source cursor.

Cargo integration has three materially different states:

- **invalid structure**: a `[workspace]` source root has no root `Cargo.toml`, or
  a `[root]` child workspace is malformed;
- **unmet prerequisite**: Cargo structure exists, but app-local Cargo is not
  installed or healthy;
- **loaded**: bundled Cargo returned compatible metadata.

The shell retains diagnostics for unmet prerequisites, but script-owned tooling
lifecycle is outside the normal command surface. Cargo-backed workflows
do not proceed until required source structure and tools validate.

## Resolution and validation

`metadata::ResolvedMetadata` is the shared snapshot used by reporting and
action commands. It resolves source-root policy, optional `[root.steam]` policy,
app-root registration state, tool health, and Cargo-derived state once.

Before an action mutates state or launches a child process, its handler supplies
a targeted `ValidationPlan`. A Cargo build requires script-prepared Rust, Git,
and valid source-root policy. A real root publish additionally requires
SteamCMD; `root publish --dry-run` does not. Commands never install or repair
failed prerequisites implicitly.

## Command surface

The interactive shell is the primary command environment. Source-bound commands
derive authority from the shell's active source, current source cursor,
discovered app root, and script-prepared tool status. Host-level direct
facades are narrow: app inspection, source selection, metadata reporting,
read-only content inspection, launch, diagnostics, and script entry.

Scripts may run local content lifecycle operations and dry-run publication
staging or IDE repair, but they may not authenticate Steam, perform real
uploads, create or delete real Workshop authority, or apply project-local IDE
changes.

## Module map

- `app`: startup and REPL control flow.
- `command`: Clap grammar and command effects.
- `content`: Workshop/content discovery, package/cache/install state,
  fingerprints, receipts, repair, and provider publication previews.
- `cargo_metadata`: invocation and typed projection of Cargo's JSON output.
- `discovery`: installation/source discovery and disjoint-root validation.
- `ide`: explicit project-local RustRover/JetBrains status and repair.
- `manifest`: strict Vapor identity vocabulary.
- `metadata`: shared environment resolution, reporting, and targeted preflight.
- `source_registry`: app-local index and active selection for external sources.
- `workspace`: source-root Cargo workspace discovery.
- `workflow`: app-local Rust/Cargo formatting, checking, testing, and validation.
- `app_local_tools`: internal app-local tool readiness model used by metadata and command preflight.
- `state`: active source selection and current content context.
- `prompt`: Reedline presentation adapter.

The executable `main.rs` only reports a fatal startup error and exit status.

## Failure behavior

Fatal workflow failures protect an authority or boundary: missing Vapor or Cargo
manifests, invalid identities, self-targeting, path escape, or overlapping
roots. Missing tools remain inspectable and explicitly repairable; they never
authorize host-tool fallback.
